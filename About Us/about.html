        <h2>Why Personality Test?</h2><br>
        <p>
            A personality test is completed to yield a description of an individual’s distinct
            personality traits.<br><br> In most instances, your personality will influence
            relationships with your family, friends, and classmates and contribute to your
            health and well-being. Teachers can administer a personality test in class to
            help your children discover their strengths and developmental needs. The
            driving force behind administering a personality test is to open up lines of
            communication and bring students together to have a higher appreciation for
            one another. A personality test can provide guidance to teachers of what
            teaching strategies will be the most effective for their students.<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            One of the most popular personality tests is the True Colors Personality
            Test. This personality test asks a serious of questions to rate your likes and
            dislikes. The test will then rate your personality as either a blue, green, orange
            or gold personality type. You may be a combination of two colors, but usually
            a student will exhibit one primary color. A personality test is not a means to
            type cast a student, but it allows teachers to understand the personality
            attributes associated with various students. You will operate as one primary
            color for the most part, but high levels of stress and other environmental
            factors can shift your personality type for short intervals. As a rule of
            thumb, you should recognize your strong attributes and keep in mind the
            attributes that irritate people.
            Teachers should disseminate a personality test to their children the first week
            of school. A personality test is a fun exercise for the class and will enable
            the teacher to more adequately plan lessons and activities for their students.
